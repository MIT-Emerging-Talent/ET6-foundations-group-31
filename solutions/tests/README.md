# Tests

## Overview

This repository includes unit tests for all solutions to ensure correctness,
handle edge cases, and validate defensive checks. Below is a brief description
of the test coverage for each solution.

### Test Coverage List

1. **Password Checker**
   - Tests include correct password validation and invalid password scenarios.

2. **Word Comparator**
   - Tests compare words with sorted characters, including edge cases like
     empty strings.

3. **String Comparison**
   - Covers cases for alphabetic sorting, invalid input types, and empty strings.

4. **Make Chocolate**
   - Tests for the correct calculation of small bars needed, including boundary cases.

5. **Prime Checker**
   - Validates numbers for "Prime" and "Not Prime" scenarios, including edge cases.

6. **Text Processor**
   - Tests functions for counting vowels, reversing text, and converting text
     to uppercase.

7. **Evaluate Temperature**
   - Tests include evaluating safe and unsafe temperature ranges with various inputs.

8. **Armstrong Number Detection**
   - Tests for Armstrong number validation, including edge cases for single
     and multi-digit numbers.

9. **List Sum User Input**
   - Validates the sum calculation for various lists of numbers, including
     empty lists.

10. **Anagram Checker**
    - Tests for anagram validation with matching and non-matching word pairs.

11. **Palindrome Checker**
    - Covers cases for regular palindromes, phrases with spaces, and mixed case inputs.

12. **Mean & Median**
    - Validates calculations for both mean and median on varied numerical inputs.

13. **Factorial**
    - Tests include factorial calculations for positive integers and edge cases
      like zero.

14. **Greatest Common Divisor**
    - Tests validate the GCD for pairs of numbers, including edge and boundary cases.

15. **my_grade**
    - Tests to give the equalevent grade for a 4.0 scale GPA.

16. **cat_dog_challenge**
    - Check if the number of occurrences
of the substrings "cat" and "dog" are the same in a given string.

17. **String Reversal (Safa Saber)**
    - Reverses the provided string and returns the reversed version.

18. **Temperature Converter (Safa Saber)**
    - Converts temperatures between Celsius and
Fahrenheit with error handling for invalid inputs

## Purpose

The tests are designed to ensure the correctness of solutions, handle unexpected
inputs, and provide confidence in their reliability.

---

## How to Run Tests

- Navigate to the test files corresponding to each solution in the `/tests` directory.
- Use `pytest` or the built-in `unittest` module to execute the tests.
