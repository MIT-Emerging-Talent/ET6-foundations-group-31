## Asking for Help

There's a fine line between confidently learning from your mistakes, and
stubbornly getting no where. Here is a structured guide for when to ask 
for help based on how long you've been stuck on the same problem:

### 1. Go Solo First

* **Dive Deep:** Tackle the challenge yourself. Experiment, learn, and
  use available resources (docs, tutorials, etc.). This builds your skills
  and understanding.
* **Embrace the Struggle:** Persist as long as you're making progress,
  even if it's slow.

### 2. When to Ask for Help

* **Assess Your Progress:** After a reasonable effort, ask yourself: Am
   I still making progress? 
* **Recognize Roadblocks:** If you're stuck, spinning your wheels, or
  not learning, it's time to change course.

### 3. Team Up

* **Discuss with Your Team:** Share your challenge with your team on Slack
   or in meetings. Explaining it often helps you understand it better.
* **Escalate if Needed:** If the team can't solve it, consider escalating
   the issue to a wider group.

### 4. Seek Expert Guidance

* **Reach Out to Coaches/Mentors:** Contact experienced team members or
  coaches for assistance on Slack.
* **Be Clear and Concise:** When asking for help, provide:
    * A clear description of the problem
    * Relevant code snippets and error messages
    * Steps you've already taken

>_Remember: Asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness.
It's how we learn and grow together as a team._
