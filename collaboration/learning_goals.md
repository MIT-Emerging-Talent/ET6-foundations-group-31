# Learning Goals

## Collective Goal

 We aim to collaboratively develop and maintain high-quality, scalable, solutions that address specific problems or needs. Although we are still learners, we already dream of changing the world through our code. Taking advantage of open communication, GitHub facilities, and the emerging talent foundation track we aim to foster an inclusive environment where team members can learn, contribute, and innovate together. By leveraging GitHub as our collaboration platform, we will ensure transparency, version control, and effective project management to deliver a solution that meets professional standards worldwide.

## Team Members Individual Goals

Raneem Rami: I aim to collaborate with my team members to create well-documented and tested solutions by helping them and benefiting from their knowledge. I also aim to gain more skills in using GitHub efficiently as I am so excited to use it again in the future.
