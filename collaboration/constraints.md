# Constraints  

Constraints serve as the guiding framework for our project,
outlining the boundaries
and conditions under which we operate. They help maintain focus,
streamline efforts, and conditions under which we operate.
They help maintain focus, streamline efforts,
and ensure we meet our objectives efficiently.
Below are the identified constraints
for our project:

## **External Constraints**  

### 🕒 **Project Deadline**  

- The project must be finalized by **January 10, 2025**. Timely completion
  is critical to align with academic schedules and team commitments.  

#### 📋 **Minimum Contribution Requirements**  

- Every team member must:  
  - Solve at least **two coding challenges** individually.  
  - Conduct a **peer review** of two challenges completed
  - to ensure quality and knowledge sharing.  

#### 🌐 **Response Time Expectations**  

- Acknowledging diverse time zones, academic workloads,
- and other personal responsibilities, our average team response time is **six hours**,
- necessitating an asynchronous workflow for seamless collaboration.

#### 🚨 **Technical Challenges**  

- Unforeseen issues such as unstable internet connections or hardware failures
  are expected. We address these by promoting redundancy in responsibilities
  and leveraging shared resources.

### **Internal Constraints: Involuntary**  

#### 🧠 **Skill Levels**  

- Our team comprises predominantly beginner to intermediate programmers.
- Challenges are curated to be **accessible yet rewarding**, primarily ranging
  from easy to medium complexity.  

#### 🤝 **Remote Collaboration Experience**  

- Limited exposure to remote teamwork may impact the speed and scope of task
  execution.
- To overcome this, we prioritize structured communication
  and well-defined workflows.

### **Internal Constraints: Voluntary**  

#### 🚀 **Challenge Cap**  

- To maintain a sustainable workload, each team member may solve up to **five challenges**
  beyond the minimum requirements.  

#### 📅 **Personal Milestones**  

- The internal deadline for completing the minimum contribution requirements
  is set for **January 5, 2025**, providing a buffer for revisions
  and final reviews.

### **Why Constraints Matter**  

Constraints are not limitations; they are the rails that keep our project moving
toward success.
 By embracing these boundaries, we ensure:  

- **Accountability**: Clear expectations for every team member.  
- **Focus**: Prioritization of tasks that align with our goals.  
- **Quality**: Time and effort to refine solutions for excellence.  

With these constraints in place, we are equipped to face challenges,
innovate within boundaries, and deliver an exceptional project. 💡
